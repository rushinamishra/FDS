Descriptive statistics therefore enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data. For example, if we had the results of 100 pieces of students' coursework, we may be interested in the overall performance of those students. We would also be interested in the distribution or spread of the marks. Descriptive statistics allow us to do this.\n","Role of Descriptive Statistics in Machine learning - Descriptive Statistical Analysis helps you to understand your data and is a very important part of Machine Learning. This is due to Machine Learning being all about making predictions. On the other hand, statistics is all about drawing conclusions from data, which is a necessary initial step.\n","Dataset Example - 1"],"metadata":{"id":"n-1HqNSbmwPg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# importing required libraries\n","\n","import pandas as pd \n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from scipy.stats import skew\n","from scipy.stats import kurtosis"],"metadata":{"id":"q_GWtLACmw3J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667598367761,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":664,"user":{"displayName":"626 Garima Singh","userId":"12747045934010542108"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\",None)  # to display all the columns\n","pd.options.display.float_format = \"{:,.2f}\".format # to display float value upto two decimals"],"metadata":{"id":"h18DLOmMm3TY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Format : A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables\n","\n","Description : A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds.\n","\n","The variables are as follows:\n","\n","price: price in US dollars (18,823)\n","carat: weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)\n","cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)\n","colour: diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)\n","clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (IF (best), VVS1, VVS2,VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1 (worst) )\n","popularity: popularity of this specs (Good, Fair, Poor)\n","x: length in mm (0--10.74)\n","y: width in mm (0--58.9)\n","z: depth in mm (0--31.8)\n","depth: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)\n","table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)"],"metadata":{"id":"bP7phhM7m7zp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# reading data from csv file \n","xls = pd.read_csv('/content/sample_data/diamonds.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"lflR8MN2m8gR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667598601623,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":437,"user":{"displayName":"626 Garima Singh","userId":"12747045934010542108"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Measures of Central Tendency\n","\n","Mean - The sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.\n","Median - The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution.\n","Mode - The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values."],"metadata":{"id":"0Ay7QynWn5GG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd \n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sb\n","from scipy.stats import skew\n","from scipy.stats import kurtosis"],"metadata":{"id":"iZdB0VY_pim4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667599054834,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":426,"user":{"displayName":"626 Garima Singh","userId":"12747045934010542108"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\",None)#To see all the columns which are present in the dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"oR8thjX_plo4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667599067640,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"626 Garima Singh","userId":"12747045934010542108"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%cd ..\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vhLDlR-bp9NQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667599215425,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17871,"user":{"displayName":"626 Garima Singh","userId":"12747045934010542108"}},"outputId":"18697efa-39b0-49b2-a33b-ba83f1af585f"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/\n","Mounted at /content/gdrive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!unzip /content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/FDS-main.zip"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RrtHF4ILqQRB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667624038386,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":461,"user":{"displayName":"626 Garima Singh","userId":"12747045934010542108"}},"outputId":"aa163810-5486-45bb-9c02-a2421bc2b461"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["unzip:  cannot find or open /content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab, /content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab.zip or /content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab.ZIP.\n"]}]}]}
